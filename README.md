#  Hotel Booking Platform API
  RESTful API for a Hotel Booking Platform that enables users to search for hotels,  make bookings, view booking details, and cancel bookings. The API incorporates user authentication, authorization, proper error handling, and scalability considerations.
  
## Features:

 * RESTful API endpoints for hotel search, booking, viewing booking details, and canceling bookings.
 * Included necessary parameters in the API requests (e.g., location, check-in/out dates, number of guests).
 * Ensured that users can only view and manage their own bookings.
 * Introduced roles (e.g., Customer, Admin) with appropriate permissions
 * Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
 * Documented proper error handling for a few scenarios, and how they would be returned with meaningful error messages.
